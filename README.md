# Deep Learning for Go (Baduk)

A study of the advances of machine learning following the AlphaGo paper in order to advance
my understanding of machine learning techniques.

A major resource is Max Pumperla and Kevin Ferguson's "Deep Learning and the Game of Go"

To start, this will be a one-to-one implementation match with what is in the book but expect
to diverge as lessons are learned.
